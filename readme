problem circa 2021: doom emacs has exactly two features that i care about and takes 10
whole ass seconds to load

solution: write a config that just has those two features

more features have been added since then

this is my config for emacs. it provides a very zoomer-friendly experience
with 21st-century features such as:
     - vim keybindings (evil)
     - on-the-fly linting (flycheck)
     - discord rich presence (elcord)
and so much more (not really).
i keep this repository so that i can keep the same editing environment
between computers easily. originally it was just an init.el that installed
two or three packages automatically but it has evolved from thats somewhat.
more recently i have taken inspiration from snackon/Witchmacs. things are
still very rough though

todo: make editing php less painful

computers are so cool because they make stupid people (me) less stupider
